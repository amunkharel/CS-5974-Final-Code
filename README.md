# CS 5974: Final Project Report  



For [CNN Model inside CNN model]

After cloning the repository, it is necessary to setup the data repoistory in the correct place in order
for each script to run.
If running in google drive / from google colab, ensure that the os.chdir() value is set to the same level as the data directory in your drive.
There is an example of what that would look like in the first cell of the notebook.

If running locally, do the same but remove the google drive mounting imports.

Add all the images inside the Resized Image folder and import all the necessary packages for main.py. Simply run python3 main.py

For [ViViT Model]
